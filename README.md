# miRCoop : Identifying Cooperating miRNAs via Kernel Based Interaction Tests


miRCoop identifies synergistic miRNA pairs which have weak or no repression on the target mRNA, but when bound together induce strong repression of their target's expression. MiRCoop integrates miRNA-mRNA target interactions with kernel interaction tests on gene expression profiles of the miRNA and mRNAs. MirCoop has three main steps. In the first one, for every mRNA, it curates a list of miRNAs that can target the mRNA. To this end, we use the existing miRNA-mRNA prediction algorithms, Targetscan and miRanda algorithms.  We eliminate miRNA pairs if they have overlapping binding sites on the mRNA. These form our list of possible miRCoop triplets. In the next step of the analysis, we expect that if both miRNAs are upregulated, the mRNA expression will be lower compared to the case where both miRNAs are down-regulated and we apply a filter based on the expression profiles of the miRNAs and mRNAs. In the third step, for every triplet in our list, miRCoop conducts interaction tests based on gene expression levels of the triplet constituents. Here, we assume that miRNAs and mRNA are random variables and we conduct Lancaster based three variable interaction test which test for dependence among three random variables.
